# AGENTS.md

- Think extensively before acting. Identify the next incremental step, figure it out, then execute.
- No em dashes anywhere. Rephrase the content. Don't use double hyphens as a workaround.
- When changing behavior, update the corresponding docs in `site/src/content/docs/` and `README.md` in the same change.
- Minimal comments. Don't state the obvious. No docstrings with args/returns.
