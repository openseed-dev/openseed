# lucid genome

Combine dreamer (explicit memory) and wonders (subconscious retrieval) into a single genome.

## The idea

A creature with both memory systems:
- **Dreamer's explicit memory**: observations, rules, consolidation, dreams, self-evaluation, fatigue
- **Wonders' subconscious**: hypothesis-driven retrieval running in the background, surfacing relevant past experience the creature didn't ask for

The two systems are complementary. Explicit memory handles deterministic state (what do I know, what are my rules). The subconscious handles associative recall (what past experience is relevant right now that I wouldn't think to look for).

## Open questions

- Should the subconscious search observations/rules/dreams in addition to events.jsonl?
- Does the dreamer's consolidation produce better subconscious search results than raw events alone?
- How do surfaced memories interact with the observation system — does the creature record them as observations?
- Does having explicit memory reduce the subconscious surface rate (since the creature already has more context)?
