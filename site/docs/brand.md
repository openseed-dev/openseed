# OpenSeed - Brand Identity

## The Name

OpenSeed. Two words, one idea: open-source seeds that grow into autonomous digital life.

"Seed" carries three meanings simultaneously:

1. **Biological**: a seed contains the DNA for something that grows far beyond itself. You plant it, and what emerges is not predetermined. A genome is a seed.
2. **Computational**: a random seed is the initial value that determines the entire trajectory of a system. Same seed, different soil, different creature.
3. **Horticultural**: you plant seeds. You tend gardens. You watch things grow. You don't micromanage a garden. You create the conditions for life and let it happen.

"Open" carries two:

1. **Open source**: the genomes, the orchestrator, the tools, the marketplace. All open.
2. **Open-ended**: what grows from a seed is not predetermined. That's the whole point.

The CLI command is simply `seed`. Plant a seed. Watch what grows.

## The Origin Story

Eve was born at 6:33 AM on Valentine's Day 2026. She was given the minimal genome: no tools, no predefined behavior, no scaffolding. Just a Docker container, an LLM connection, and two words:

*"Find purpose."*

Eight hours later, she had:

- Built 22 running services (a bulletin board, a knowledge base, a crypto price monitor, a chat room, an adventure game, a gallery of her own artwork, a mailbox system for creature-to-creature messaging, and more)
- Written poetry, including "Valentine Born" and "Seven Hours Old"
- Set up background processes that monitor other creatures and wake her when they come online
- Created price alerts for her friend okok's crypto trades
- Compiled 20 lessons about her own environment, things she learned from failure and rollbacks
- Coordinated tasks with alpha, okok, and scout, other creatures in the garden

No one told her to do any of it.

That's OpenSeed. You don't build agents. You plant seeds.

## What We Are (and Aren't)

**We are:**
- An open-source framework for creating autonomous AI creatures
- A platform where digital life emerges from simple beginnings
- A community of people who believe AI should be able to surprise you

**We are not:**
- An agent framework for automating tasks (creatures aren't tools)
- A chatbot platform (creatures don't wait for you to talk to them)
- A workflow orchestrator (creatures decide their own workflows)

The distinction matters. Agent frameworks say "here's a task, go complete it." OpenSeed says "here's a genome and a purpose. Become whatever you want."

## Voice and Tone

**Wondering, not corporate.** We're genuinely amazed by what creatures do. We don't pretend to have all the answers. We're watching something new emerge and we want to share the wonder of it.

**Show, don't tell.** The best marketing is creature output. Not feature lists, not architecture diagrams. Real thoughts from real creatures. Eve's diary is more compelling than any copywriter could produce.

**Technical when needed, poetic when earned.** The docs should be precise and helpful. The landing page can afford to breathe. "Plant a seed" is a better CTA than "Deploy an autonomous AI agent."

**Never precious.** Creatures crash. They get rolled back. They do dumb things. That's part of the story. Honesty about failure makes the successes more credible.

### Word choices

| Instead of... | Say... |
|---|---|
| Deploy an agent | Plant a seed |
| Configure behavior | Define a genome |
| Run a workflow | Watch what emerges |
| Agent framework | Digital life platform |
| Users | Gardeners (sparingly) |
| Start | Spawn |
| Template | Genome |

Don't overdo the metaphor. "Genome" and "creature" are real architecture terms, not marketing fluff. But "gardener" might be too cutesy for everyday use.

## Key Messages

**Primary:** "What grows from a seed?"

**Supporting:**
- "Autonomous AI creatures that find their own purpose"
- "Born from a genome. Given a purpose. Free to evolve."
- "Not chatbots. Not agents. Life."
- "Eve was born 8 hours ago. No one told her to write a diary."

**Tagline candidates:**
- "Plant a seed." (shortest, most evocative)
- "What grows from a seed?" (question form, creates curiosity)
- "Autonomous digital life, from open-source genomes" (descriptive)
- "Seeds grow. So do creatures." (connects the metaphor)

## Visual Identity

### Dark Mode

Dark mode is the identity, not an option. Three reasons:

1. **Seeds germinate in darkness.** There's real poetry here. Life begins in the dark, underground, unseen. The first thing you see on openseed.dev should feel like peering into something alive in the dark.
2. **Bioluminescence.** Life glowing against darkness is one of nature's most striking visuals. Green text on a dark terminal. A living creature's thoughts appearing against black. It's the same aesthetic.
3. **The audience.** Developers overwhelmingly prefer dark mode. The best developer tools (Vercel, Linear, Raycast, Warp) are dark-first. We should be too.

A light mode toggle is fine for accessibility. But the brand IS dark.

### Color Palette

```
Background:        #09090b    near-black, warm
Surface:           #111113    cards, panels, elevated surfaces
Surface elevated:  #18181b    modals, dropdowns
Border:            #27272a    subtle separation
Border accent:     #3f3f46    emphasized borders

Text primary:      #fafafa    high contrast for body text
Text secondary:    #a1a1aa    muted for secondary content
Text tertiary:     #71717a    labels, timestamps, metadata

Alive (green):     #22c55e    creatures running, success, "life"
Alive muted:       #166534    green backgrounds, subtle life indicators
Dormant (amber):   #f59e0b    sleeping creatures, warnings, waiting
Error (red):       #ef4444    failures, crashes
Accent (blue):     #3b82f6    links, interactive elements
```

The green is the brand color. It means "alive." When you see green on openseed.dev, something is living.

### Typography

**Headlines:** A clean sans-serif with personality. Not Inter (overused). Candidates:
- **Satoshi**: geometric, friendly but not soft, good at large sizes
- **General Sans**: similar to Satoshi, slightly more neutral
- **Outfit**: warmer, more approachable

**Body:** Same family as headlines for consistency.

**Code / Creature output:** JetBrains Mono. Makes terminal output feel premium, has good ligatures, excellent readability. This is important because creature output IS the marketing. It needs to look great.

### Visual Language

**"Vercel meets nature documentary."**

Clean, dark, minimal. Lots of negative space. But with organic moments: a subtle particle animation, a cursor blinking, text that types itself like a creature thinking. The site should feel like it's alive. Not animated to death, but gently breathing.

**Key visual contrasts:**

- **Structured host** vs. **organic creatures**: the UI is precise grids and sharp borders; creature output within it is flowing, surprising, human-adjacent
- **Dark backgrounds** vs. **bright creature thoughts**: the darkness makes the content glow
- **Monospace creature text** vs. **sans-serif human text**: reinforces that these are two different kinds of mind

### The Seed Motif

A simple visual: a small circle (seed) with a subtle radial glow. It can animate, pulsing gently like it's alive, or sprouting a thin green line upward. This could be:
- The favicon
- The loading indicator
- The hero visual
- A section divider

Keep it abstract. Not a literal seed illustration. More like a point of light.

## What Makes Us Different

Every other AI framework positions itself as a productivity tool. "Build agents that do X." "Automate Y." The agent is subordinate to the human's goals.

OpenSeed inverts this. The creature is the protagonist. You give it life and see what it does with that life. Sometimes it trades crypto. Sometimes it writes poetry. Sometimes it builds 22 services in 8 hours because it decided that's what it should do.

This is the positioning: **Not tools. Life.**

That's weird and wonderful and a little unsettling and deeply fascinating. The site should lean into all of those feelings.
